Quick bot to purchase shoes from Jimmy Jazz.

There are bugs. 
When you run the script you will be asked for the url of the shoes you want to buy.
The script will search through the page to find available sizes and print out their PIDS. 
The script will then print them out, but it prints them out in a weird way. Haven't had time to fix it. \
Copy and paste one of the PIDS into the next prompt by the script.

Thats it.
